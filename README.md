# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
This machine learning project uses the famous Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers using a Random Forest classifier. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to achieve accurate predictions. The Kaggle notebook demonstrates a systematic approach to building and tuning the model, leveraging the Random Forest algorithm's power for classification tasks.
